            <h1>History of Land Surveyors</h1>
            <p>Land surveyors have been a cornerstone of American history since the very beginning. Historical land surveyors are an important part of the country's settling. In fact, many of the Founding Fathers of America themselves were surveyors. Here are some famous surveyors from history;</p>

            <h2>William Clark and Meriwether Lewis</h2>
            <p> William Clark and Meriwether Lewis are names that everybody learns in  school, who were, in fact, land surveyors. The pair was tasked with some  of the most intensive land surveying in American history. While Lewis  had a reputation as more of a planner, Clark was an expert surveyor and  mapmaker. Together, the partners traveled across the land then known as  the Louisiana Purchase, making their way to Oregon to scout it out.</p>

            <h2>George Washington</h2>
            <p>George Washington is one of America’s most famous (and earliest) land  surveyors. The young future president got his bright start at the age of  17 in 1749. It was not long until he was appointed to be the Surveyor  General for Virginia. Washington played an essential role at this time  because surveying the land promoted expansion westward.</p>

            <h2>Thomas Jefferson</h2>
            <p>George Washington was not the only president to work  as a surveyor. Thomas Jefferson was appointed to work as the Albermarle  County surveyor in Virginia in 1773. He also promoted surveying by  sending Lewis and Clark on their expedition to explore the land gained  through the Louisiana Purchase.</p>

            <h2>Benjamin Banneker</h2>
            <p>As a self-taught African American mathematician, astronomer, and surveyor, Benjamin Banneker was remarkably successful. Banneker was well know for creating a series of almanacs in the 1790s, the almanacs covered everything from astronomy to ocean tidal patterns, to surveying. In 1790, Banneker was invited to be part of the team surveying the future site of Washington, D.C.</p>
