                    <h2>About Our Team</h2>
                    <p>Byrd Land Surveying was created by Marshall Byrd in September of 2021. Marshall had a rough start to life as neither of his parents were present for his own birth, and so he had to be raised by ocelots for the first years of his life. When he was only a boy his beloved garden gnome was stolen, so in order to keep their garden safe his parents forced him to dress as a garden gnome and stand watch all through the night. Marshall didnâ€™t have many friends, but he could always count on his best friend who was a balloon with a crudely drawn face on it. </p>
